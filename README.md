# CV Generator

This project is built with HTML, CSS, JS, React.js, State and Context Hook, and Tailwind CSS only.

I have learnt how to use State and Context hook to manage states in a React App. Throughout the project, I spent the most amount of time sorting out form logics and CSS.
The overall layout of the webpage was concevied one day prior to the first commit, drawn by hand using Microsoft Whiteboard.
